Understanding how to work with machine learning models, particularly for analyzing hotel reviews, required a deep dive into natural language processing techniques. Balancing the accuracy of the sentiment analysis while interpreting the nuances in customer reviews, such as sarcasm or mixed sentiments, was particularly difficult. Additionally, this was my first experience working with Flask for the backend. Setting up the web framework, managing routes, and ensuring that the sentiment analysis tool integrated smoothly with the Flask app posed several challenges. Learning how to efficiently handle requests, connect to the database, and ensure the tool could process large volumes of data while maintaining a fast response time was a new and demanding experience. However, these challenges ultimately helped me gain a stronger understanding of Flask and sentiment analysis."}]}},{id:2,ProjectHeader:{title:"PhishScan",publishDate:"Sep 1, 2022",tags:"Machine Learning"},ProjectImages:[{id:2,title:"YouTube Video",videoUrl:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ndyptY-zwtQ?si=u_DXJvyb7Wu6L5a9",type:"video"}],ProjectInfo:{ClientHeading:"About Client",GitHubLink:"https://github.com/Jemerylim/phishscanapi",CompanyInfo:[{id:1,title:"Name",details:"Mobile Co Ltd"},{id:2,title:"Services",details:"Mobile App Development"},{id:3,title:"Website",details:"https://mobilecompany.com"}],ObjectivesHeading:"Objective",ObjectivesDetails:"The objective of PhishScan is to develop an efficient web-based solution for detecting phishing emails using a combination of blacklist-based and machine learning-based techniques.
